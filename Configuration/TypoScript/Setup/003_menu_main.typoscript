##  Main Menu  ##
mainmenu = HMENU
mainmenu {
  ## define the first level as text menu
  1 = TMENU
  1 {
    ## Thereâ€™s another important consideration for multiple-level menus:
    ## do you want to see all child pages of the current page or also children of the sibling pages?
    ## Here we want to se also the childen of the sibling pages  
    ## This behaviour can be toggled on and off with the expAll property.
    expAll = 1
    ## The NO command stands for the normal state menu. You must set this to active with NO = 1 
    ## (this also applies to all other menu states)
    NO = 1
    NO {
      ## function is like the linkWrap attribute
      ## includes also any submenus in addition to the link of the menu item
      wrapItemAndSub = <li>|</li>
      ## 
      stdWrap.htmlSpecialChars = 1
      ## specify the title attribute of the a-tag around the menu item.
      ## This would use the description // subtitle // title field of the a title="" attributes 
      ATagTitle.field = description // subtitle // title
    }
  ## The command ACT stands for an active state, as soon as you are on a page, 
  ## this page gets your previously defined state in your menu, in this example a class.
    ACT < .NO
    ACT.wrapItemAndSub = <li class="act">|</li>

    CUR < .NO
    CUR.wrapItemAndSub = <li class="cur">|</li>
  }
  ## With the command 2 <.1 all configurations that you wrote in the first level (1 = TMENU)
  ## are inherited to the next lower level (2 = TMENU)
  2 < .1
  2.wrap = <ul>|</ul>
  3 < .2
}

## The subpart mainmenu outputs the main navigation
## inherited from mainmenu
mainmenu-v-level1 < mainmenu
## You have to adjust the "entryLevel" command depending on your page layout (backend).
## This command represents the entry level from which the menu should be rendered.
mainmenu-v-level1.entryLevel = 1
## but there is a way, which makes our definitions look nicer to the eye: 
## we define wraps seperately. Like every content object HMENU also provides a property named stdWrap.
## here: but use another wrap as above 
mainmenu-v-level1.1.wrap = <ul id="main-menu-v" class="sm sm-vertical sm-{$minimale_distribution.SmartmenuThemes} hidden-sm">|</ul>
